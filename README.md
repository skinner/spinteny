###Comparative genome visualization

![Spinteny screenshot](spinteny-screenshot.png)

Spinteny is a prototype tool for visualizing the similarities between the genomes of different species.  In the screenshot above, there are three genomes.  Each genome is wrapped horizontally around a cylinder, and the relationships (aligned regions) between genomes are represented by vertical/diagonal connections.
