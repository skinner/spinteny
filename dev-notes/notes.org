* shading
* gridlines
* deal with precision issues
** send base positions to shaders and transform them there?
** emulate larger precision with multiple smaller precision numbers?
* real data
** work out hierarchical rank/select data representation
*** document?
** implement generation tool
*** find/write alignment parser
** implement client-side
* handle resize
* better transparency
** depth peeling
** and/or weighted average approx. OIT
*** requires float textures/render targets
overflows otherwise
* location cursor on mousemove over genome
* click to rotate to align on a specific location
* genomic feature rendering
* inertial scrolling
