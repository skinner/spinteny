* to do
** gridlines
** deal with precision issues
*** send base positions to shaders and transform them there?
*** emulate larger precision with multiple smaller precision numbers?
** real data
*** work out hierarchical rank/select data representation
**** document?
*** implement generation tool
**** find/write alignment parser
*** implement client-side
** handle resize
** location cursor on mousemove over genome
** click to rotate to align on a specific location
** genomic feature rendering
** inertial scrolling
** transparency?
*** depth peeling
*** and/or weighted average approx. OIT
**** requires float textures/render targets
overflows otherwise
* notes
** zooming
*** range: 0.8 to 200000
**** for human:
from 1/2 genome per screen (1.5gb per screen-width) to
7500 bases (1.5gb/200000) per screen-width
***** if screen is 1000 pixels, that's 7.5 bases per pixel
